# 4 How to run this Application

## 4.1 Get a Yelp Fusion API key

This application looks pretty much the same like the original [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com) website.

It leverages the free [Yelp Fusion REST API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3) for which you need an API key.

1. Head over to the [Yelp Fusion API documentation](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3)
2. Click on `Create App` and sign in if you haven't done so already
3. Once you have signed in, click on the `Get Started` button. If you already have an app, then you will already see the API key
4. Fill out the form for [creating a new app](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app)
5. Copy the generated `API key`. This is a [bearer token](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25838183/what-is-the-oauth-2-0-bearer-token-exactly/25843058) that must be put inside the header of each request

## 4.2. Provide the URL from which search results can be fetched

You need to provide a value for the `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` which should expose a `GET /search` endpoint that expects both the `term` and the `location` as a query parameters.

This can just be a plain Lambda function that makes a REST call to the Yelp fusion API.

To simplify the process, you can add a new `.env.local` file (already gitignored) with

```
touch .env.local
```

put the base URL in there

```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=my-base-url.com
```

If you then run `npm run dev` instead of `npm start` then the env vars will be automatically sourced.
As an alternative, to pull the value of the env var in, you can also source it manually with

```
source .env.local
```

Please bar in mind that if you close your terminal session, you will need to source this file again.
That's why we recommend to just run `npm run dev`.

## 4.3 Installing the dependencies and running the app

Install the dependencies by running

```
npm install
```

and then start the app with

```
npm run dev
```
